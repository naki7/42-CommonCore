The Road gave her what she was missing. And now she's gone. This can end right here, right now. I came here for power. You have power. Juice me up.
I wouldn't.
I won't.
Sit down.
We're gonna find your brother.
That's what you want, right? Tommy isn't waiting out there. Not in a body, anyway. That's what got Rio in such a tizzy. She knows you could do it for him.
Give him another life! Another spin around the dance floor.
You never do. Time to grow up. [SMACKS FLOOR] Close your eyes. Your last moments with Tommy. Tell me.
You do. It's there. Try. You were ten. You lived in Westview. You and your brother.
Breathe with him. Breathe.
It's your mother folding her world. That's okay. It's okay.
